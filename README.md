# RetailStoreApp
This is the final repo for my project

This project contains 3 test cases in the test file.
from controller, the data will be passed to the service and all the calculations are being done there based on the user type as in customer, affiliated or an employee.
data is passed statically in the controller.
just run the project on eclipse and type http://localhost:8080/order/addNew on browser and you'll get the order details in json format.
if you want to change any input please go to the OrderController.java file, in this file I have provided static data which you can change if you want.
